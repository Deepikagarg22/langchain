Conclusion:

The main source of energy for a heating and cooling system has a significant impact on the energy consumption of a home. In general, electricity is the most efficient energy source, followed by natural gas, oil, and propane. The age of the system, the type of inside and outside units, and the size of the units also affect energy consumption.

In Minnesota, a 25-year-old home with a natural gas heating system and a central air conditioning system would typically consume around 10,000 kWh of electricity per year. If the home were updated with a new heat pump system, the energy consumption could be reduced to around 7,000 kWh per year.3488100	1559		13-11-2019	29440	2	1983	SFD Deemed Measure	2512	20096	2512	8	216	1728	13	3	15	Partial poly		Elect	Less than 7	ASHP Split	12	0		ASHP Split	13	0				0	Smoke				Yes works		8616	Open	50	0	0	350		0	0	350		0	0	0	Attic	100%	Attic	100%	Needs minor repair		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	36.6
